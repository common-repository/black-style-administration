Changes the visual design of the Wordpress administration area to the "Black" theme.

== Description ==

Black Style Administration is based upon Barunio Style Administration with a couple of additions and corrections for the latest Wordpress release (currently 2.3.2). As such, many of the images are kinda funky looking (I did not edit them other than changing colors here and there). I’ve changed almost all the colors, but a few still elude me. If you find one, let me know and the release will be updated.

I am aware of a few rendering issues, most notably concerning images in the “Create New Post/Page” section and “Add Link” section. I’m kinda burnt out from screwing with some other issues with the Barunio Theme, so I can’t work on them at the moment, but again, if anyone has a solution, shoot me an email about it and I will update the release.

Compatible with Firefox 2.0 and Opera 9 under Linux.

Black Style Administration is released under the GNU Public License Version 2.

== Installation ==

1. Backup your upload.css file from /wp-admin/css/upload.css to a safe directory
2. Unpack this archive to your Wordpress install directory
3. Go to the WordPress Amin Panel and select Plugins.
4. Activate 'Black Style Administration'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This does not work in Browser X =

Send me the complete details on the Browser, Wordpress Install, and Operating System and I will do some testing/debugging to correct any errors.

= Admin Plugin Y does not appear correctly =

Email the version of the plugin you are using, your Wordpress install and Browser for testing purposes. It may just be that the CSS for your plugin is not currently supported.

= Compatability =

Confirmed Usable Plugins:
1. SuperEditor
1. RSS Stream version .2

Notable Errors:
I am aware of css issues in Firefox and Opera concerning some images which should be there but are not. Also, many plugins that rely on the default color being dark might be broken. If there are any that need to be fixed, shoot me an email about the Install you are using and plugin information so I can send out a bugfix.
